Digital Magic Spell 

A Unity asset by Justin Chee

This spell asset is ready to be used in any scene, just drag and drop to create a spell effect that looks both digital and magical at the same time.
It branches out to collect the area's data to focus the skill for a more potent attack.

Hope you find this useful and I'll do my best to come out with more!
